 Kevin and Yov play a new game: Blackjack . Kevin is in office, so let's play for low stakes, okay? Like $10,000? Oh, it's a deal. Let's see who wins. Anybody gets to 21? Uh, wins. If you go over 21, you're going to lose .
 Game theory is about all kind of strategic interactions among self intereste . Matt Jackson and Kevin Jackson co-teach the class on game theory . Kevin is an associate professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia .
 Game theory has become an essential tool to understanding a lot of different interactions . It's used in everything from auctions to people people's behavior and financial markets to international conflict to understanding political interactions .
 A lot of the problems that economic gamers like Matt think about when they get bigger, they have computational dimensions . So as you want to solve these problems in the real world, it's necessary to leverage ideas from algorithms and complexity to make them work in practice .
 The course will run about seven weeks . It's really an introductory course . It doesn't presume that people have any experience in Game 3 before . It'll assume a tiny bit of background and probability and calculus .
 Some of the course is graded and some of which isn't . We'll have quizzes to test comprehension after the videos . Online forums are an essential part of the class. You really want to form study groups .
 We do have a TAEZ that will monitor the forums, both at British Columbia and at Stanford . At the end of the day, it'll only work as a community we all work together . Please, because the large numbers don't send us personal email, it's not that we don't like to speak to, we just won't be able to handle it . If you want to follow us personally on our personal sites by all means, but no, please, friend requests .
